This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

 Math-magicians is a fictional company based in France. They have requested your help to build a simple product that would assist them with their calculations. An important thing to notice is that they have asked for a product that is not just fully-functional, but also beautiful and user-friendly.
